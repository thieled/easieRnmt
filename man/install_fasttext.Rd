\title{Install FastText in a Python virtual environment}
\usage{
install_fasttext(
  wheel_url =
    "https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/files/14355061/fasttext-0.9.2-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl.zip",
  python_version = "3.11",
  venv_name = "r-easynmt",
  verbose = TRUE,
  conda_path = NULL,
  force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wheel_url}{Character string. URL to the zipped FastText wheel for
Windows. Defaults to the official release of version 0.9.2 for Python 3.11
and 64-bit Windows.}

\item{python_version}{Character string. Python version to use when creating
the conda environment via \code{easieRnmt::install_conda_venv}. Default is
\code{"3.11"}.}

\item{venv_name}{Character string. Name of the conda virtual environment.
Default is \code{"r-easynmt"}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, print progress messages during
installation. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{conda_path}{Optional character string. Path to a conda installation.
If \code{NULL}, the default conda installation is used.}

\item{force}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, uninstall any existing installations of
\code{fasttext} or \code{fasttext-wheel} before reinstalling. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if the function completes. If
installation fails, warnings are raised but the process continues.
}
\description{
This function installs the FastText library inside a conda virtual
environment managed through \code{reticulate}. On Windows, a precompiled
wheel is downloaded, unpacked, and installed. On Linux and macOS, the
library is installed directly from PyPI. If installation fails (for example
due to unsupported Python versions), the function does not stop but issues
a warning instead.
}
\details{
On Windows, FastText is not officially supported and compilation from
source often fails. This function therefore installs a precompiled wheel
distributed as a zipped file. On Linux and macOS, the package is installed
directly from PyPI with \code{pip install fasttext}.
