\title{Initialize the r-easynmt Python environment}
\usage{
initialize_easynmt(
  python_version = "3.11",
  venv_name = "r-easynmt",
  ask = TRUE,
  force = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  conda_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{python_version}{Character scalar. Python version to use for the
environment. Default is \code{"3.11"}.}

\item{venv_name}{Character scalar. Name of the virtual environment to
create or activate. Default is \code{"r-easynmt"}.}

\item{ask}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prompt the user before creating or
overwriting an environment. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{force}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, force reinstallation of the
environment even if it already exists. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, print informative messages about
the environment configuration and installed packages. Default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{conda_path}{Optional character scalar. Path to the conda
installation to use. If \code{NULL}, the default conda installation is
used.}
}
\value{
This function is called for its side effects. It prints messages
about the environment and package versions if \code{verbose = TRUE}, and
sets the global option \code{easynmt_initialized = TRUE}.
}
\description{
This function initializes and verifies the Python environment used by
\pkg{easieRnmt}. It builds on \code{\link{install_easynmt}} by activating
the specified virtual environment, checking the Python configuration,
and verifying that required Python packages are correctly installed.
}
\details{
Specifically, the function:
\itemize{
\item Ensures that the Python environment created by
\code{install_easynmt()} is active.
\item Prints the active environment, Python path, and Python version.
\item Verifies that PyTorch is installed and reports its version as
well as whether CUDA is available.
\item Checks whether \code{fasttext} and \code{EasyNMT} are installed
and reports their versions.
\item Sets a global option (\code{easynmt_initialized = TRUE}) so that
subsequent calls can skip redundant initialization.
}

This function is typically called once at the beginning of a session to
prepare the Python backend for translation tasks. It assumes that
\code{\link{install_easynmt}} has been run at least once to set up the
required environment.

Note that \code{fasttext} is optional. If it is not available, EasyNMT
can still work with \code{langdetect} or \code{langid} for language
detection, but automatic detection may be less accurate. In such cases,
it is recommended to specify the source language explicitly when calling
translation functions.
