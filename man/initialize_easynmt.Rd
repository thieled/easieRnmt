\usage{
initialize_easynmt(
  python_version = "3.11",
  conda_env_name = "r-easynmt",
  ask = TRUE,
  force = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  conda_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{python_version}{Character scalar. Python version to use for the
environment. Default is \code{"3.11"}.}

\item{conda_env_name}{Character scalar. Name of the conda environment to
create or activate. Default is \code{"r-easynmt"}.}

\item{ask}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prompt the user before creating or
overwriting an environment. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{force}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, force reinstallation of the
environment even if it already exists. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, print informative messages about
the environment configuration and installed packages. Default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{conda_path}{Optional character scalar. Path to the conda
installation to use. If \code{NULL}, the default conda installation is
used.}
}
\value{
This function is called for its side effects. It prints messages
about the environment and package versions if \code{verbose = TRUE}, and
sets the global option \code{easynmt_initialized = TRUE}.
}
\description{
Initializes and verifies the Python environment used by \pkg{easieRnmt}.
It builds on \code{\link{install_easynmt}} by activating the specified
conda environment, checking the Python configuration, and verifying that
required Python packages are correctly installed.

Specifically, the function:
\itemize{
\item Ensures that the Python environment created by
\code{install_easynmt()} is active.
\item Prints the active environment, Python path, and Python version.
\item Verifies that PyTorch is installed and reports its version as
well as whether CUDA is available.
\item Checks whether \code{fasttext} and \code{EasyNMT} are installed
and reports their versions.
\item Sets a global option (\code{easynmt_initialized = TRUE}) so that
subsequent calls can skip redundant initialization.
